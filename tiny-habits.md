# Tiny Habits

### 1. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8), what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The concept of "Tiny Habits" by Dr. BJ Fogg was the most interesting. Starting with very small habits, like doing two push-ups instead of 50, can lead to significant changes over time. This emphasizes the importance of manageable, scalable habits.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To make new habits easier:
- **Motivation (M)**: Increase your desire to perform the habit.
- **Ability (A)**: Simplify the habit.
- **Prompt (P)**: Create triggers that remind you to perform the habit.

### 3. Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating after completing a habit reinforces the behavior by creating a positive emotional connection, making it more satisfying and likely to be repeated. This positive reinforcement helps anchor the new habit.

### 4. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNeXuCYiE0U), what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The "Two-Minute Rule" by James Clear was most interesting. It suggests starting new habits with versions that take less than two minutes to reduce resistance and gradually build the habit.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book emphasizes changing your identity to support habit change. Focus on becoming the type of person you want to be, like shifting from "I want to run a marathon" to "I am a runner." This aligns habits with your self-image.

The book suggests:
- Simplifying the habit.
